# AR T-Rex Runner

This is a small project I am working on when I take a break from job hunting. I aim to recreate the dino run game from Google Chrome in AR.

# What it does so far

The current version just displays a pixel dino on top of the target image (see below).

# What I plan to add

The first thing on my list is making the dino job when the user taps their phone. Once I have that implemented, I will cacti to the AR and have it move across the screen.
Then I need to add a simple UI button to restart the game when the dino hits a cactus.

# Technologies/Libraries/Frameworks used

I am developing this game with Unity and the Vuforia Engine.
